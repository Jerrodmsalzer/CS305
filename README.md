Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Our client was Artimis Financial and they employed us to examine thier web-based app and conduct a vunerability assessment. Artemis Financial wants to modernize their operations. As a crucial part of the success of their custom software, they also want to use the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a RESTful web application programming interface (API). They are seeking Global Rain’s expertise about how to protect the organization from external threats.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing? 

when vulnerabilities were found we gave recommendations on how to fix any issues and apply industry standard security techniques to better ensure Artimis Financials clients are safe to use thier app.
it is important to code securly to ensure the saftey of sensitive personal or business information, coding securly also makes debugging code easier by fixing and implmenting saftery procedures in the actual coding process instead of after the code has been finished. software security adds many layers of protection to a companies files and information.


What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I wasnt able to generate the checkSum verification I believe it was based on not being able to get my versions to match, that has been the hardest part for me is not knowing what causes an error and searching the web to find out how to fix it.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
 
adding multiple types of security measures and updating exsisting saftey features were able to give us more security. Also we used the vulnerability assessment flow diagram to determine what stpes we took next to secure the app.

 
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?/What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
by testing the code using checkSum verifications and generating a maven dependancy check to determine any vulnerabilities. All of these tools would be useful in the future and I will continue to develop these skills for future projects.



Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would use the dependancy check to show future employers my skill and knowledge as well as any other techniques i willlearn in the fututre.
